# Basic Onshape CAD
## Caster
Base: My first real CAD piece on Onshape. It was very easy to do, and all done from my Chromebook!

Subassembly: I got my first taste of Onshape mates and mate connecters, and found them a little tricky but very helpful

## Challenge
A fun little challenge, that makes an optical illusion! I had a little trouble at the end, trying to find the right mate, but I eventually figured out that it was the Cylindrical Mate, because the axis that revolved, also needed freedom of movement.
